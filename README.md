# observatorium/configuration

This project is used to generate all necessary Observatorium and Telemeter v2 files
that are copied into [app-interface](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface) repository,
Trying  to automate the additional step of copying files from [github.com/observatorium/configuration](https://github.com/observatorium/configuration).
We hope that causes things to be less out of sync and easier to maintain.

## Generation

To generate all the files for Observatorium simply run `make` from the inside of this repo.
